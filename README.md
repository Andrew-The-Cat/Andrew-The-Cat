### 👋 Hi, I’m @Andrew-The-Cat (the mewo / schrodinger's catto)
- Interested in anything and everything that has to do with computers; making, breaking, commanding- whatever
- Currently learning how not to suck at programming- go, rust and finally getting to https and databases cause I've been avoiding them for quite a while :3
- My current skillset is mainly built upon quick learning and lil projects in various languages (C, C++, Java, C#, Python, mcfunction) - but looking towards the future I'd love to become competent at networks and forensics

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video games- at least for the time being with a couple projects coming up once I've finished my courses ||
📫 You may reach me on discord @andrew_the_cat (just send me a message request and avoid just saying 'hi') ||
Pronouns: any/all (preferrably they/them doe) ||
Fun fact: I have no idea what I'm doing :D
